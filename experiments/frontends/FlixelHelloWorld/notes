Forgot what I did specifically, it was probably http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/
except I had to overwrite their binary b/c it didn't work right (guessing it was an issue with the link,
or flixel not following the link, not sure, but solution was to delete /usr/bin/flixel, and then write my
own, which was a shell script to invoke flixel).

Note that Flixel prints its header information for every command, even successful ones.
You'll want to look at the bottom of the output for the relevant information.

$ flixel tpl -n FlixelHelloWorld
$ sed -i ''  /super.create/i\\\n'add(new FlxText(0, 0, 100, "Hello World!"));'\n source/MenuState.hx

You can also turn of the splash screen with
$ sed -i '' /skipSplash:Bool/s/false/true/ source/Main.hx
