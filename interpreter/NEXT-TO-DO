can we make a SymbolTable which is haxe.ds.StringMap ?
have all instantiation go through one spot so we have access to the correct classes and such.
switch fillFrom to use an enum indicating the type of return value is an expression, or some state in a larger algorithm

experiment with object model represented as records instead of classes (see experiments dir)
push more on that acceptance test.
