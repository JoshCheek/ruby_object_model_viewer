* have all instantiation go through one spot so we have access to the correct classes and such.
* switch fillFrom to use an enum indicating the type of return value is an expression, or some state in a larger algorithm
* experiment with object model represented as records instead of classes (see experiments dir)
* push more on that acceptance test.
* Check out ruby_parser, looks much smaller than Parser, so might be easier to bootstrap, and Ryan was really nice to me at RubyConf while Peter was kinda dismissive of this project
