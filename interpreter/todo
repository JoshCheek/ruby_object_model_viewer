Immediate:
  the_machine.definitions: move templates between the two
  global vars keep the dollar sign
  move machine.js into instructions and get rid of it altogether. There should only be the one vm
  implement special constants (true/false/self)

Maybe future:
  option to see a list of bytecodes
  build fails if bytecode emitted doesn't match bytecode signature list
  build fails if bytecodes are used, but not defined
  build fails if misalignment between bytecode args and instruction args
  could use a real parser if we preprocess it to remove the context sensitivity
