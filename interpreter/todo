Immediate:

Maybe future:
  option to see a list of bytecodes
  build fails if bytecode emitted doesn't match bytecode signature list
  build fails if bytecodes are used, but not defined
  build fails if misalignment between bytecode args and instruction args
  could use a real parser if we preprocess it to remove the context sensitivity
