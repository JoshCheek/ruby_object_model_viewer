5.8e+07 <-- make sure ruby parser thing can handle this (for object model)
integrate with moi (prob rename that, since everyone gets it suggested to them, apparently)
subscription types:
  make content that is served by us
  make content that is powered by us but branded with your stuffs - probably based on how many people your content reaches
  we have our own product powered by it, subscription to that product
  some sort of free product to give back to the community and illustrate the value of the paid product
contribute to the people who made it possible (namely whitequark right now, but could maybe contribute to the rspec team and the rack team. idk, look at what gems we're using)
figure out how to deal with ownership / licensing / money
if it makes a sufficient amount of money
  I'll hire someone to perform my teaching responsibilities
  I'll work on whatever I feel is important
  Sometimes this will be teaching, sometimes oss, sometimes this
  w/e it is that I am compelled to do
places to grow:
  if the interpreter got sufficiently capable, we could use it as an in-browser alternative to Opal (since Opal only has one instance... a pretty serious design flaw, imo)
  can integrate with SiB. Instead of Open3, we just instantiate a new Ruby Interpreter and run it that way
  Can evaluate code, then, on the client-side instead of needing to ship it up to the server and send it to eval.in
  Add games:
    The self game
    Where will Ruby go next?
Competencies
  Reasonable rendering
  Reasonable navigating (e.g. granularity, show me only code executing in my file, etc)
  Saving a user's files
  A local version so the user can see across files and such
  Ability to display in the code editor what the browser is currently interpreting
  This is nuts, but Rails integration so that we can use it after the first 6 weeks
  Fake file system so we can use it in SalesEngine
  Lessons that make use of it :P
